   <h2> Terraria King Slime Sprite Project (CS1) <br>
     <h4> This project that I created in CS1 was very unpredictable. In this <br>
     project, I used pillow coding on python "which we learned about in class" <br> 
     to create create pixel art gif animations of a terraria boss's sprites that <br>
     would be in the actual game. What I didn't expect though, was just how time <br> 
     consuming it would be... <br>
     I think that a large part of the time consuming nature of the project was due <br>
     to the code that I used to create it. I feel like my optimization of the code <br>
     was underwhelming, and due to that it turned out to take way longer than it <br>
     should have... <br>
     What I believe that I learned from this project was that I should focus on <br>
     creating the most optimal code for something to make it more efficient, then <br>
     begin to actually start the project. My biggest flaw with it was that I only <br>
     took around one week of the project time to optimize the code, then I focused <br>
     on creating the detail within the artistic aspect of it. I think that if I <br>
     had just spent another week or two making the code more efficient, than I <br>
     could have had twice as much of a result... <br>
     In conclusion to my project though, I was at the very least able to produce <br>
     my minimum expectations for it. I still was able to create all of the animations <br>
     and an extra hit animation that would be displayed in the actual boss fight <br>
     in terraria, so I still was able to create a result, but I am disapointed that <br>
     I couldn't create another boss's sprite animations... <br>
     It was a learning experience though, and at least now I know what I need to do for <br> 
     the next time that I have a project during my time taking CS as a subject <br>
