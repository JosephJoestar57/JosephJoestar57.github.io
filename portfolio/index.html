      I was born in the state of California and 
      lived in the city of <br> Elk Grove until I was 
      around 10 years old, then I moved to <br> Texas, 
      and as of now, I still live in the city of Houston.                                                                      
      <br> I strive to become greater at computer science 
      as a subject and <br> succeed, because the subject 
      as a whole sparks my desire to create. <br> As for my 
      future, I want to pursue becoming a video-game developer. <br>
