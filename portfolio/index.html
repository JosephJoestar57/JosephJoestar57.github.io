   <h2> <i> HS Endorsement: Stem <br>
   CTE Pathway: Programming & Software Developement </i></h2>

      
 
      I was born in the state of California and 
      lived in the city of <br> Elk Grove until I was 
      around 10 years old, then I moved to <br> Texas, 
      and as of now, I still live in the city of Houston. 
      <br> I strive to become greater at computer science 
      as a subject and <br> succeed, because the subject 
      as a whole sparks my desire to create. <br> As for my 
      future, I want to become a video-game developer. <br>
      Video games formed a large part of my childhood 
      and <br> gave me a strong competitive desire 
      to be better at everything I do,<br> which is my 
    cause for wanting to pursue creation of video games as a career. <br><br>
