    <h1>About Me<br> 
      <font size="6">
      I was born in the state of California and 
      lived in the city of Elk Grove until I was 
      around 10 years old, then I moved to Texas, 
      and as of now, I still live in the city of Houston. 
      I strive to become greater at computer science 
      as a subject and succeed, because the subject 
      as a whole sparks my desire to create. As for my 
      future, I want to become a video-game developer, 
      because video games formed a large part of my 
      childhood and gave me a strong competitive desire 
      to be better at everything I do.
